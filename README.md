# GoShare — P2P File Sharing

Project overview

## Project overview

GoShare is a planned peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system written in Go. The goal of this project is to design and implement a simple, secure, and efficient P2P protocol and reference implementation that enables peers to discover one another and exchange files directly without relying on a single centralized server.
